## Current Status

### Completed Tasks
1. Created 9 articles for Amazon:
   - 3 articles on hiring practices
   - 3 articles on company culture
   - 3 articles on technical focus

2. Created 9 resumes for TCS Software Engineer role:
   - 3 fresher resumes
   - 3 junior resumes
   - 3 mid-level resumes

### Pending Tasks
1. Articles Creation:
   - Google (9 articles)
   - Microsoft (9 articles)
   - TCS (9 articles)
   - Infosys (9 articles)
   - Flipkart (9 articles)

2. Resumes Creation:
   - Amazon (9 resumes for each role)
   - Google (9 resumes for each role)
   - Microsoft (9 resumes for each role)
   - TCS (9 resumes for Data Scientist and Product Manager roles)
   - Infosys (9 resumes for each role)
   - Flipkart (9 resumes for each role)

## Resume Structure
Each resume follows this structure:
1. Source and metadata
2. Personal information
3. Professional summary
4. Technical skills
5. Professional experience
6. Education
7. Projects
8. Achievements
9. Certifications
10. Languages

## Experience Levels
For each role, we create three experience levels:
1. Fresher (0-1 year experience)
2. Junior (2-3 years experience)
3. Mid-Level (4-6 years experience)

## Roles
For each company, we create resumes for three roles:
1. Software Engineer
2. Data Scientist
3. Product Manager

## Technical Requirements
The model will be built using:
- TensorFlow.js for the AI model
- Node.js for the backend
- React for the frontend
- MongoDB for data storage

## Next Steps
1. Complete the remaining articles for all companies
2. Create resumes for Data Scientist role at TCS
3. Create resumes for Product Manager role at TCS
4. Create all resumes for remaining companies
5. Set up the TensorFlow.js environment
6. Implement the model architecture
7. Create the data processing pipeline
8. Develop the training infrastructure

## Notes
- Each resume is tailored to the specific company's requirements
- Articles provide context about company culture, hiring practices, and technical focus
- Resumes are created with realistic experience levels and achievements
- Technical skills are aligned with company-specific requirements
- All data is dated April 3, 2025, for consistency
