Our system is built on a modern tech stack that prioritizes performance, privacy, and real-time interaction:

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, SQLite with Prisma
- **AI Components**: TensorFlow.js, Web Speech API, WebAssembly
- **Privacy**: Local storage encryption, WebAssembly for local processing

## Key Features

### 1. Resume Analysis
Our advanced resume parsing and analysis system helps candidates optimize their resumes for maximum impact. Using natural language processing, it provides targeted feedback on content alignment with job requirements.
