```

## User Flow

The AIPS system follows a sequential flow where users progress through different modules in a logical order:

1. **Initial Access**
   - On startup, the system displays a login/registration form
   - New users register with email, password, and basic profile information
   - Existing users log in with credentials
   - Upon successful authentication, users are directed to their dashboard

2. **User Dashboard**
   - First-time users are prompted to upload their resume
   - The dashboard provides navigation to all system modules
   - Progress indicators show completion status of each module

3. **Module Progression**
   - Resume Analysis → Target Job Selection → Technical Assessment → Virtual Interview → Analytics
   - Each module unlocks after completing the previous one
   - Users can revisit completed modules to refine their preparation

4. **Feedback Loop**
   - After each module, users receive feedback and improvement suggestions
   - Analytics dashboard updates with new data after each completed activity
